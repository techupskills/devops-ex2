See [docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md](docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md) for detailed usage instructions, architecture overview, and troubleshooting tips.

## üîÑ Auto-Restart Services

Services automatically restart when your codespace resumes! The devcontainer is configured to:
1. **Detect existing services** and restart only what's needed
2. **Quick dependency check** to ensure everything is ready  
3. **Intelligent startup** with proper service health checks

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Service Management

If you need manual control:

```bash
# Check service status
scripts/service-manager.sh status

# Start all services
scripts/service-manager.sh start

# Stop all services  
scripts/service-manager.sh stop

# Restart all services
scripts/service-manager.sh restart

# View logs
scripts/service-manager.sh logs

# Initial setup (only needed once)

```
